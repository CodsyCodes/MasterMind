# MasterMind
The user has to guess a four-digit code generated by computer within limited number of tries. If the digit in the code guessed by the user is correct and is in the correct position then the letter 'R' is shown below it, correct digit and wrong position gets a 'Y' and a completely wrong digit 
gets a 'B'. For example, if the code to be guessed is "4719" and the user guesses "8314" then he gets an output "BBRY".
